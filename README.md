## Introduction

Welcome to the homepage of Dexterity Dash, a hand-eye coordination tool/game aiming to make training hand-eye coordination fun for those suffering from head trauma and brain injury. This engineering project aims to develop a hand-eye coordination game using the DE1-SoC FPGA board, Verilog for coding, and ModelSim for testing. The game enhances users' hand-eye coordination by requiring them to press illuminated buttons in a specific sequence within a time limit to score points.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create a hand-eye coordination game. The DE1-SoC board, Quartus for Verilog coding, and ModelSim for testing are utilized to implement the game's logic. The game involves pressing one of 8 buttons that light up, and after each correct press, another button lights up. A default timer of 1 minute challenges users to press as many correct buttons as possible to score the most points.
