## Introduction

Welcome to the Hand-Eye Coordination Game/Tool project! This engineering project aims to develop a hand-eye coordination game using the DE1-SoC board, Verilog for coding, and ModelSim for testing. The game enhances users' hand-eye coordination by requiring them to press illuminated buttons in a specific sequence within a time limit to score points.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create a hand-eye coordination game. The DE1-SoC board, Quartus for Verilog coding, and ModelSim for testing are utilized to implement the game's logic. The game involves pressing one of 8 buttons that light up, and after each correct press, another button lights up. A default timer of 1 minute challenges users to press as many correct buttons as possible to score the most points.

## Software Setup

Provide details on the software setup, including the use of Quartus for Verilog coding and ModelSim for testing. Include any specific configurations or settings required for the DE1-SoC board.

## Game Rules

Explain the rules of the hand-eye coordination game. Detail the button-press sequence, scoring mechanism, and the 1-minute time limit. Emphasize how the game helps users develop and enhance their hand-eye coordination skills.

## Project Structure

Outline the structure of the project's Verilog code. Describe the key modules and their functionalities, emphasizing the use of a Finite State Machine (FSM) to control the game flow.


## Screenshots

Insert screenshots of the game, including the home screen, button sequences, and scoring displays.
